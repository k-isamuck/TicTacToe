# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This project runs like a normal tic-tac-toe game. It takes input from the user and alternates between 'X' and 'O'. Three of the same character in a row on the board, in any direction results in a win. If this does not happen before the round of turns (9) ends then it results in a tie. 

This is from my first assignment for the course CS210 at SDSU. I have just started learning C++, although I do have a decent background in Java. This is also my first time writing a README as well as uploading to Git. I hope to continue improving!
